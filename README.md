# Regression tests

## Preparing workflow for testing

* each workflow should have a separate dictionary under `workflows4regtests`
* the workflow with command line interface should be in the `workflow` subdirectory
* all input data needed to run the workflow should be under the `data_input` subdirectory
* all reference results should be saved in the `data_ref` subdirectory
* each workflow should have `parameters.json` to describe environment, input data, script and command to run the workflow, and chosen tests for the workflow outputs, e.g.

```json
